# AI Interpreter

Real-time speech-to-speech translation for Windows meeting applications.

You speak Tamil. Microsoft Teams hears English. It works with Teams, Zoom and
Google Meet because it outputs through a **virtual microphone** rather than
integrating with any particular meeting platform.

Everything runs locally. No cloud service, no API key, no audio leaves your
machine.

## Quick start

```powershell
git clone <repository-url> C:\ai_interpreter
cd C:\ai_interpreter
.\scripts\bootstrap.ps1
```

That creates the virtual environment, installs everything, and runs the
environment check. Then:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 --check           # verify the environment
.\run.ps1 --print-config    # show the settings actually in use
```

Full instructions, including what to install and why: [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

## What is in the box today

- **Clean Architecture** in four layers with dependency injection throughout.
- **Typed configuration** from layered YAML with schema validation; an
  unrecognised key stops startup instead of being silently ignored.
- **Hardware profiles** selected automatically. The same code runs small
  quantised models on a two-core laptop and full-quality models on an RTX GPU.
- **Non-blocking rotating logs** that never stall the audio thread.
- **Privacy by construction**: conversation text is kept out of log files
  unless you explicitly opt in, nothing is persisted by default, and no
  telemetry exists.
- **Microphone capture** with device selection, WASAPI preference, stateful
  resampling to 16 kHz, high-pass filtering, and a drop-oldest callback buffer.
- **Neural voice activity detection** (Silero via ONNX Runtime, 0.5 ms per
  32 ms frame) with an adaptive energy detector as a model-free fallback.
- **Utterance segmentation** with pre-roll, so the first syllable is never
  clipped, plus test recordings you can listen to.
- **Speech to text** routed per language: IndicConformer for Tamil (linear
  decode cost — the property that makes CPU streaming possible) and Whisper
  on CTranslate2 for English, plus a `--benchmark` command that measures
  decode time on your own machine instead of trusting an estimate.
- **Tamil ↔ English translation** with IndicTrans2-200M on CTranslate2:
  0.19–1.3 s per sentence on two cores, with an LRU cache that answers
  repeated phrases in ~0.03 ms.
- **459 tests**, plus lint and strict type checking, all passing.

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 64-bit | Windows 11 64-bit |
| Python | 3.12 | 3.12 |
| CPU | 2 cores | 6+ cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| GPU | none (CPU fallback) | NVIDIA RTX, 6+ GB VRAM |
| Disk | 12 GB free | 20 GB free |

Latency depends heavily on hardware. On an RTX GPU the design target is
roughly 0.7-0.9 s from the end of your sentence to the first translated audio.
On a two-core laptop, expect 1.5-2.5 s. Real measurements are produced by the
benchmarks in Phases 4, 6 and 10 — the numbers above are design targets, not
results.

## Licence

MIT for this project's own code. Model and dependency licences differ and are
listed in [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md); two of them are
non-commercial and are deliberately never used as defaults.
